- Track and evaluate impact

## Types of Resources

## Allocation Process

### Annual Budgeting

ICS develops an annual budget that:
- Aligns with strategic priorities
- Allocates resources to each program cell
- Establishes reserves for sustainability
- Is approved by the Board of Directors

### Participatory Allocation

Within the framework of the annual budget, ICS employs participatory processes that enable contributors to influence resource allocation:

1. **Program-Level Budgeting**: Each program cell receives a baseline budget
2. **Discretionary Fund**: A portion of resources is allocated through participatory mechanisms
3. **Community Proposals**: Community members can propose initiatives for funding

### Decision-Making Thresholds

Resource allocation decisions follow these thresholds:

- **Under $100 (or equivalent)**: Can be approved by a single Core Team member
- **$100-$500**: Requires approval from at least two Core Team members
- **Over $500**: Requires a formal proposal and decision process as outlined in the [Proposal Process](../metagovernance/proposal_process.md)
