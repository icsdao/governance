# Purpose

### Overarching Project Purpose

- To help people live more sustainable and connected lives through community-driven initiatives that promote environmental stewardship, resource sharing, and meaningful interconnections.

### Cell Specific Purpose

- To build and operate a decentralized governance structure for the Institute for Community Sustainability that enables transparent, participatory decision-making and effective resource allocation.
- To prototype and implement web3 tools for community sustainability, including decentralized governance, transparent treasury management, and impact attestations.
- To serve as a local node in the decentralized regenerative web3 ecosystem, connecting local sustainability efforts with global regenerative finance movements.

### Relationship to Regen London & Stakeholders

- ICS operates as part of the Regen London structure, alongside Greenpill London.
- ICS is participating in the Reimagining Power Project (RPP) as an implementation partner, exploring how web3 can shift power, transform systems, and shape better futures.
- As a federal not-for-profit organization, ICS maintains a traditional Board of Directors for legal and fiduciary responsibilities while implementing DAO-inspired governance for operational decision-making.

# Practice

## Roles

### Point Person(s)

- @heenal.eth - The point person acts as the primary point of contact for ICS

### Core Team

- Operational contributors who share responsibility for ICS's outcomes are referred to as the "Core Team".

- Core Team members:
  - @heenal.eth
  - [Additional core team members to be added]

- **Core team commitments:**
  1. Be aware of this Cell State document and operate in alignment with the policies and practices outlined in it.
  2. Attend 75-80% of core team meetings.
  3. If unable to attend a core team meeting, the team member will coordinate with the rest of the core team to make sure that their accountabilities are being managed and necessary updates are shared with the team.
  4. Utilize the ICS collaboration protocols to ensure that decisions are clearly made and recorded.

### Contributors

- Contributors who are not responsible for the project's outcomes, but who accomplish specific tasks related to its goals hold the "contributor" role.
- This includes both ICS Contributors and Greenpill London Contributors.

### Role Badges

- Roles ownership is declared on-chain using the Hats Protocol tree.
  - Tree ID: https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/100/119

- Proposed role structure:
  - Regen London (parent hat)
    - ICS Contributor
    - ICS Core Team (automatically includes ICS Contributor privileges)
    - Greenpill London Contributor
    - Greenpill London Core Team (automatically includes Greenpill London Contributor privileges)

## Contributor Rewards

- The core team uses task-based rewards to compensate team members and contributors.
- On occasion, the core team may choose to allocate monetary compensation to team members and contributors retrospectively via a mechanism of its choosing.

# Coordination

## Communication

- The core team uses Discord as our main team communication mechanism

## Meetings

- The core team meets regularly to coordinate on projects.
- Meeting notes are kept in the CharmVerse doc repo: https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-workspace-6136932233367063

## Decision-Making

- The cell uses a consent-based decision-making process:
  - Proposals are developed collaboratively
  - Decisions proceed when there are no paramount objections
  - Objections are treated as valuable information
  - Proposals are improved through integration of concerns

- **Minor decisions** - can be made in team meetings and logged in meeting notes or in Discord.

- **Major decisions** including resource allocation decisions will be run through the proposals process and may use Snapshot voting: [SNAPSHOT_SPACE]
  - Major decisions that require on-chain voting will use Snapshot
  - Typical threshold for approval is simple majority (>50%) with a minimum quorum of 3 core team members
  - The voting period is typically 3-5 days

- **Community Proposals** - The Core team can receive and decide to accept or reject community proposals using the same process as for major decisions.

## Shared Tools

# Progress Tracking

## Goals

- Set up basic governance infrastructure (multisig, Hats Protocol roles, documentation)

  - Governance systems are operational, with at least three active ICS participants
  - At least one Hypercert for the Repair Café is minted and publicized
  - The first Green Pill Network meetup in London, Ontario is successfully hosted
  - An onboarding workshop is developed, piloted, and refined based on participant feedback
