# ICS Community Guidelines

These guidelines articulate the shared expectations, norms, and practices that shape our community interactions at the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS). They complement our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) by providing more specific guidance on how we work together to achieve our mission of helping people live more sustainable and connected lives.

## Shared Values

Our community is founded on the following values, which inform all our interactions and decisions:

- **Equity, diversity, and inclusivity**: We actively work to create a community where everyone is welcome, valued, and able to contribute fully.

- **Community resilience and solidarity**: We recognize our interdependence and support one another through challenges and opportunities.

- **Radical love and imagination**: We approach our work with deep compassion and creative vision, embracing possibilities beyond the status quo.

- **Sustainability and land stewardship**: We acknowledge our responsibility to the land and strive to build regenerative relationships with the earth and its resources.

- **Trust and accountability**: We build trust through transparency, consistency, and reliability, taking responsibility for our actions and impacts.

- **Self-awareness and reflexivity**: We continuously examine our assumptions, biases, and the effects of our actions.

- **Humility, honesty, and courage**: We approach our work with a willingness to learn, a commitment to truth, and the bravery to challenge systems of oppression.

## Communication Practices

### In Meetings

- **Check-ins**: We begin meetings with brief check-ins to build connection and context-awareness.

- **Active listening**: We give our full attention to whoever is speaking, seeking to understand before responding.

- **Balanced participation**: We create space for all voices and perspectives, being mindful of dynamics that might privilege certain voices over others.

- **Timeboxing**: We respect everyone's time by starting and ending meetings promptly and adhering to agreed-upon timeframes for discussion.

- **Documentation**: We record key decisions, action items, and insights from our meetings in shared spaces for future reference.

### In Digital Spaces

- **Responsiveness**: We aim to respond to communications within 2-3 business days, while respecting each other's boundaries and work-life balance.

- **Clarity**: We communicate clearly and directly, providing necessary context and being specific about expectations or requests.

- **Appropriate channels**: We use the most appropriate communication channel for the message (e.g., Discord for team coordination, email for formal communications).

- **Inclusive language**: We use language that is accessible and inclusive, avoiding jargon when possible and explaining it when necessary.

- **Constructive feedback**: We offer feedback that is specific, actionable, and compassionate, focusing on behavior rather than identity.

## Decision-Making

- **Consent-based approach**: Our default decision-making approach is consent-based, meaning that decisions proceed when there are no paramount objections.

- **Objections as resources**: We view objections as valuable information that can improve proposals, not as obstacles to be overcome.

- **Transparency**: We make the decision-making process visible and accessible to all affected parties.

- **Documentation**: We record decisions, including the reasoning behind them, in shared spaces for future reference.

- **Levels of decision-making**: We recognize different levels of decisions (minor vs. major) and use appropriate processes for each (see our [Cell State](../cell_state.md) document for details).

## Onboarding and Offboarding

### Onboarding

New community members can expect:

- A warm welcome and introduction to the community
- Access to key documentation and resources
- A point person to support their integration
- Clear explanation of roles, responsibilities, and opportunities for contribution
- Regular check-ins during their first few months

### Offboarding

When leaving the community, members can expect:

- A respectful acknowledgment of their contributions
- A clear transition process for any responsibilities they held
- The opportunity to share feedback about their experience
- Continued connection to the community in appropriate ways

## Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise, we follow these steps:

1. **Direct communication**: Parties involved in a conflict first attempt to address it directly with each other.

2. **Facilitated conversation**: If direct communication doesn't resolve the issue, parties can request a facilitated conversation with a neutral third party.

3. **Formal mediation**: For more complex conflicts, formal mediation may be initiated through our established process.

4. **Community accountability**: In cases where harm has occurred, we follow restorative practices to address the harm and rebuild trust.

Throughout this process, we commit to:

- Approaching conflict with curiosity and compassion
- Focusing on specific behaviors and impacts rather than assumptions about intentions
- Seeking solutions that address root causes and restore relationships
- Respecting privacy while maintaining appropriate transparency

## Accessibility and Inclusion

We work to make our community accessible to all by:

- Providing multiple ways to participate and contribute
- Accommodating different learning and communication styles
- Offering support for those facing barriers to participation
- Continuously educating ourselves about accessibility and inclusion
- Inviting and responding to feedback about how we can improve

## Revision Process

These Community Guidelines are a living document that will evolve as our community grows and learns. Suggestions for improvements can be submitted through our governance process outlined in the [Cell State](../cell_state.md) document.
