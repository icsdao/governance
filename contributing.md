# Contributing to ICS Governance Documentation

This guide outlines how to maintain and contribute to the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) governance documentation. Our governance repository serves as the source of truth for our organizational structure, decision-making processes, and shared agreements.

## Guiding Principles

When contributing to this repository, please align your work with these core values:

- **Transparency**: All governance changes should be visible, attributable, and accessible to all community members
- **Consent**: Changes should follow our consent-based decision-making process
- **Sustainability**: Documentation should help us build resilient governance systems
- **Inclusion**: Consider diverse perspectives and ensure documentation is accessible
- **Regeneration**: Look for opportunities to improve existing structures and processes

## Proposing Changes

Changes to governance documentation should follow our formal proposal process:

1. **Discuss**: Start by discussing your proposed change in the ICS Discord server or during community calls
2. **Draft**: Create a draft proposal using the template in [policies/metagovernance/proposal_process.md](policies/metagovernance/proposal_process.md)
3. **Review**: Share your draft for community feedback and iterate based on input
4. **Formal Decision**: Once refined, submit for formal consent-based decision making
5. **Implementation**: After approval, implement the change following the technical process below

For minor changes (typos, formatting, clarifications), you can use a simplified process described in the metagovernance policies.

## Technical Process for Updates

### Repository Structure

The repository uses a three-part structure:

- **Agreements**: Commitments among participants (Code of Conduct, Community Guidelines, etc.)
- **Policies**: Procedures and standards for operations
- **Archives**: Historical records of decisions and proposals

### File Naming and Organization

Follow these conventions when adding or modifying files:

1. Use lowercase for all filenames
2. Replace spaces with underscores
3. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
4. Group related files in appropriate directories

### Commit Message Standards

Well-structured commit messages improve clarity:

```
Update [document name]: [brief description]

[Reference to proposal/issue number]
[Optional longer explanation]
```

Examples:
- "Update resource_allocation.md: Add community fund guidelines (#12)"
- "Fix broken links in policies/index.md"
- "Archive proposal-7: Implementation complete"

### Documentation Style

When writing documentation:

1. Begin with a clear purpose statement
2. Use plain language accessible to all community members
3. Include examples where helpful
4. Organize content with clear headings and lists
5. Link related documents using relative paths
6. Update indexes when adding new documents

## Review Process

All significant changes undergo review by at least one Core Team member before implementation. For technical support with git or the repository structure, reach out in the #governance channel in Discord.
