# ICS Proposal Process

This document outlines the process for creating, discussing, deciding on, and implementing proposals within the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS).

## Purpose

The proposal process serves to:
- Ensure transparent and participatory decision-making
- Create clear documentation of decisions and their rationale
- Enable thoughtful consideration of changes before implementation
- Establish accountability for follow-through on approved decisions

## Proposal Types

ICS recognizes the following types of proposals:

### Minor Proposals
- Operational decisions that don't significantly impact resources or governance
- Changes to existing programs or processes that don't fundamentally alter their purpose
- New initiatives that require minimal resources and don't create significant new commitments

### Major Proposals
- Significant resource allocations (over $500 or equivalent)
- Changes to governance structures or decision-making processes
- New programs or major modifications to existing programs
- Policy changes that affect the entire organization
- Establishment of formal partnerships or collaborations

## Proposal Process

### 1. Drafting

Any contributor may draft a proposal. Proposals should include:

- **Title**: A clear, descriptive name
- **Author**: Name(s) of the proposer(s)
- **Date**: When the proposal was created
- **Type**: Minor or Major
- **Summary**: A brief overview of the proposal (1-3 sentences)
- **Background**: Context and motivation for the proposal
- **Details**: Specific changes or actions being proposed
- **Impact**: Expected outcomes and potential effects on the organization
- **Resources**: Any resources required for implementation
- **Timeline**: Expected implementation schedule
- **Success Metrics**: How outcomes will be measured

Proposal templates are available in the CharmVerse workspace.

### 2. Discussion

Once drafted, proposals undergo a discussion period:

- **Minor Proposals**: At least 3 days of discussion
- **Major Proposals**: At least 7 days of discussion

During this period, community members may:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest improvements
- Express concerns
- Indicate support

The proposer is responsible for:
- Responding to questions and concerns
- Incorporating feedback as appropriate
- Documenting significant changes to the proposal

Discussion may take place in Discord, in community meetings, or in comments on the CharmVerse proposal document.

### 3. Decision

After the discussion period, proposals move to decision:

#### For Minor Proposals:
- Decision may be made by consent in a Core Team meeting
- Proposal is approved if there are no paramount objections from Core Team members
- The decision is documented in meeting notes

#### For Major Proposals:
- Decision may be made through Snapshot voting
- Voting period lasts at least 3 days
- Quorum requirement: At least 3 Core Team members must participate
- Approval threshold: Simple majority (>50%)

#### For Both Types:
- Decisions are documented in CharmVerse
- All community members are notified of the outcome

### 4. Implementation

For approved proposals:

- An implementation owner is assigned
- Key milestones are documented
- Regular progress updates are shared
- Changes to governance documents are made through the process outlined in the [Governance](../../governance.md) document

### 5. Review

After implementation:

- Outcomes are evaluated against success metrics
- Learnings are documented
- Adjustments are made as needed

## Snapshot Voting (for Major Proposals)

When Snapshot voting is used:

- Votes are cast on [SNAPSHOT_SPACE]
- Eligible voters include all Hat holders in the ICS Hats Protocol tree
- Voting options typically include "Yes," "No," and "Abstain"
- Voters may include comments explaining their vote

## Expedited Process

In urgent situations, the Core Team may initiate an expedited process:

- The proposal is clearly marked as "Expedited"
- Discussion period may be shortened to 24 hours
- Decision may be made immediately after the shortened discussion period
- Rationale for expediting must be documented

## Governance Repository Updates

Proposals that affect governance documentation follow the process outlined in the [Governance](../../governance.md) document. This includes:

- Changes to the Cell State document
- Updates to agreements and policies
- Additions to or modifications of roles

## Amendment

This proposal process may itself be amended through a Major Proposal following the process outlined above.
