# ICS Program Management Policy

This document outlines how the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) manages its programs and initiatives to maximize impact and align with organizational mission and values.

## Purpose

Effective program management enables ICS to:

Role definitions and responsibilities are managed through the Hats Protocol, with detailed role descriptions in Charmverse.
