# Institute for Community Sustainability - Governance Repository

This repository contains the official governance documentation for the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS). As a community-driven organization focused on sustainability and collective action, we maintain transparent, version-controlled governance to ensure our operations align with our values and mission.

## Repository Structure

This governance repository is organized into three main sections:

- **[Agreements](agreements/)**: Core commitments between participants, including our Code of Conduct, Community Guidelines, and Operating Agreement.
- **[Policies](policies/)**: Procedures and standards for various activities, organized by functional area.
- **[Archives](archive/)**: Historical records of past proposals and decisions, providing institutional memory.

## About ICS

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is a federal not-for-profit organization based in London, Ontario. Our vision is collective liberation: a world where people live in peace and harmony with each other and nature. Our mission is to help people live more sustainable and connected lives.

We are guided by our values:
- Equity, diversity, and inclusivity
- Community resilience and solidarity
- Radical love and imagination
- Sustainability and land stewardship
- Trust and accountability
- Self-awareness and reflexivity
- Humility, honesty, and courage

## Governance Framework

ICS governance follows a cell-based structure that combines established practices of not-for-profit governance with decentralized, participatory elements inspired by web3 technologies and DAO principles. Our governance model aims to distribute decision-making power while maintaining alignment with our mission and values.

The core document describing our governance structure is the [Cell State](cell_state.md) document, which outlines the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes of our organization.
