# Constitution of the Institute for Community Sustainability

## Preamble

We, the members and contributors of the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS), establish this Constitution to guide our collective work toward a vision of helping people live more sustainable and connected lives. Founded in London, Ontario, ICS bridges traditional community organizing with innovative web3 governance tools to create transparent, participatory systems that serve community resilience and environmental stewardship.

Our work is grounded in the values of equity, diversity, inclusivity, community resilience, radical love and imagination, sustainability and land stewardship, trust and accountability, self-awareness and reflexivity, and humility, honesty, and courage. Through programs like the Repair Café, Thing Library, and GreenPill London chapter, we demonstrate that community-driven solutions can address local needs while contributing to global movements for regenerative change.

This Constitution establishes governance frameworks that distribute power, enable meaningful participation, and ensure our operations align with our values as we experiment with decentralized decision-making and transparent resource allocation.

## Article 1: Mission and Organizational Structure

### Mission and Vision

ICS exists to help people live more sustainable and connected lives through community-driven initiatives that promote environmental stewardship, resource sharing, and meaningful interconnections. Our vision is collective liberation: a world where people live in peace and harmony with each other and nature.

### Legal and Governance Structure

ICS operates as a federal not-for-profit organization under Canadian law while implementing innovative governance approaches that bridge traditional structures with decentralized technologies. This hybrid model maintains legal compliance while experimenting with transparent, participatory decision-making processes.

### Core Programs and Activities

ICS advances its mission through:
- **Repair Café**: Community repair events that divert waste from landfills while building skills and connections
- **Thing Library**: Tool and equipment lending that reduces consumption and increases resource access
- **GreenPill London**: Local chapter bridging regenerative web3 with place-based sustainability
- **Learning Circles**: Educational programming that builds capacity for sustainable living
- **Governance Innovation**: Experiments in decentralized decision-making and transparent resource allocation

## Article 2: Participation and Roles

### Community Membership

Community members are individuals who participate in ICS programs and align with our values. Membership is open to all who share our commitment to sustainability, community resilience, and equitable participation.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who take active roles in advancing ICS's mission through specific projects, programs, or organizational functions. Contributors participate in governance processes appropriate to their level of engagement and responsibility.

### Core Team

The Core Team consists of operational contributors who share responsibility for ICS's strategic direction and outcomes. Core Team members commit to participating in governance processes, attending regular coordination meetings, and ensuring organizational accountability and transparency.

### Board of Directors

ICS maintains a Board of Directors as required by Canadian not-for-profit law. The Board fulfills legal and fiduciary responsibilities while supporting rather than constraining the organization's experimental governance approaches.

## Article 3: Decision-Making and Governance

### Consent-Based Decision-Making

ICS employs consent-based decision-making as our primary governance method. Decisions proceed when there are no paramount objections, with objections treated as valuable information for improving proposals. This approach enables responsive decision-making while ensuring community voices are heard and considered.

### Decision Domains

Governance authority is distributed across appropriate domains:
- **Program-level decisions** are made autonomously by program cells using established processes
- **Organizational decisions** affecting multiple programs or strategic direction involve broader community input
- **Legal and fiduciary decisions** follow requirements for not-for-profit governance while maintaining transparency

### Web3 Governance Integration

Where appropriate, ICS uses blockchain-based tools to enhance transparency and participation:
- **Multisig treasury management** for financial transparency and security
- **On-chain role definition** through systems like Hats Protocol
- **Impact attestations** to document and verify community contributions
- **Participatory resource allocation** experiments using quadratic funding and similar mechanisms

### Documentation and Transparency

All significant decisions are documented accessibly, with reasoning and implementation plans clearly communicated. This creates institutional memory and enables community accountability while supporting learning and iteration.

## Article 4: Resource Stewardship and Allocation

### Stewardship Principles

ICS manages resources according to principles of transparency, equity, and alignment with mission and values. Resource allocation decisions prioritize community benefit, environmental sustainability, and long-term organizational resilience.

### Treasury Management

Financial resources are managed through:
- **Transparent budgeting processes** that enable community input into priorities
- **Multisig wallet governance** for cryptocurrency and blockchain-based assets
- **Regular financial reporting** that maintains accountability to community and funders
- **Participatory allocation mechanisms** that distribute decision-making where appropriate

### Program Resource Allocation

Program cells receive resource allocations through transparent processes that balance autonomy with organizational coherence. Programs maintain accountability through regular reporting and community engagement while having flexibility to respond to local needs and opportunities.

## Article 5: Community Standards and Accountability

### Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct

All ICS participants agree to follow established Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct that translate our values into practical behavioral expectations. These documents are living resources that evolve based on community experience and changing needs.

### Conflict Resolution and Accountability

ICS maintains restorative approaches to conflict resolution that prioritize learning, healing, and community strengthening over punishment. Processes include direct communication support, mediation resources, and community accountability mechanisms that address harm while rebuilding trust.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

ICS actively works to remove barriers to participation and create welcoming spaces for diverse community members. This includes accommodating different communication styles, providing multiple ways to contribute, and continuously learning about inclusive practices.

### Community Care

Recognizing that sustainable organizing requires sustainable people, ICS prioritizes community care through mutual aid practices, emotional support resources, and approaches that honor different capacity levels and life circumstances.

## Amendment Process

This Constitution may be amended through proposal processes that ensure broad community input and consent. Proposed amendments require:
1. **Community discussion** for at least 30 days with accessible opportunities for input
2. **Refinement** based on community feedback and concerns
3. **Consent-based decision** by Core Team members and active Contributors
4. **Board approval** where required by legal obligations
5. **Documentation** of changes and rationale for future reference

The amendment process balances stability with adaptability, ensuring the Constitution can evolve while maintaining the integrity of our foundational commitments.
