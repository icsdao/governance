# ICS Decision-Making Policy

This document outlines the decision-making methods, processes, and principles used by the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS).

## Purpose

Effective decision-making processes enable ICS to:
- Make timely decisions aligned with our mission and values
- Include diverse perspectives in shaping our direction
- Create transparency and accountability
- Balance autonomy with collective wisdom
- Build shared ownership of outcomes

## Decision Domains

ICS decisions fall into the following domains:

### Cell Decisions
Cell decisions concern the operations and activities of a specific cell and do not significantly impact other cells or the organization as a whole. These decisions are made within the cell using its established decision-making process.

**Examples:**
- How to organize a specific Repair Café event
- Which items to add to the Thing Library
- Format and content for a specific Learning Circle

### Cross-Cell Decisions
Cross-cell decisions impact multiple cells but do not require changes to organizational governance or strategy. These decisions are made collaboratively by representatives of the affected cells.

**Examples:**
- Coordinating schedules for events across programs
- Sharing resources between programs
- Joint communications or outreach efforts

### Organization-Wide Decisions
Organization-wide decisions impact ICS's governance, strategy, or allocation of substantial resources. These decisions involve the Community Assembly and, where legally required, the Board of Directors.

**Examples:**
- Annual budget allocation
- Strategic planning
- Major policy changes
- Establishing new programs

## Decision Methods

ICS employs multiple decision methods depending on the context:

### Consent-Based Decision-Making

For most cell and cross-cell decisions, ICS uses consent-based decision-making, which operates on the principle that a decision can move forward when there are no paramount objections.

**Process:**
1. **Proposal presentation**: A clearly articulated proposal is presented
2. **Clarifying questions**: Participants ask questions to understand the proposal
3. **Reactions**: Participants share initial thoughts and reactions
4. **Amendments**: The proposer may make amendments based on feedback
5. **Objection round**: Participants state whether they have any paramount objections
6. **Integration**: If objections exist, they are integrated into an improved proposal
7. **Decision**: When no paramount objections remain, the proposal is adopted

**Paramount objections** are objections that:
- Identify a significant risk or harm to the organization or its mission
- Cannot be addressed through future adjustments or evaluations
- Are based on the interests of the organization, not personal preference

### Voting

For certain organization-wide decisions, particularly those requiring formal approval, voting may be used. Voting processes:

- Are clearly defined for each type of decision
- Include appropriate notice periods
- May use tools such as Snapshot for transparent, verifiable voting
- Require minimum participation thresholds
- May apply different majority requirements depending on the decision type

**Standard voting thresholds**:
- Simple majority (>50%) for most decisions
- Two-thirds majority (≥66.7%) for major governance changes

**Quorum requirements**:
- At least 3 Core Team members for most decisions
- At least 5 Core Team members for major governance changes

**Voting duration**:
- At least 3 days for standard votes
- At least 5 days for major governance changes

## Decision Documentation

All significant decisions are documented with:

- The decision that was made
- The decision-making method used
- Key context and considerations
- Any objections or concerns raised
- Implementation plans or next steps
- Date of decision and participating decision-makers

Decisions are documented in:
- Meeting notes for decisions made in meetings
- CharmVerse for formal proposals
- Snapshot for on-chain votes

## Decision Implementation

For each decision, the documentation includes:

- Who is responsible for implementation
- Timeline for key actions
- Resources allocated (if applicable)
- How success will be measured
- When and how the decision will be reviewed

## Decision Review

Significant decisions include plans for review to:

- Evaluate outcomes against expectations
- Identify learnings for future decisions
- Make adjustments as needed

## Technology

ICS uses the following tools to support decision-making:

- **CharmVerse**: For proposal documentation and discussion
- **Snapshot**: For formal on-chain voting at [SNAPSHOT_SPACE]
- **Discord**: For communication and coordination around decisions

## Amendments

This decision-making policy may itself be amended through the proposal process outlined in the [Proposal Process](proposal_process.md) document.
