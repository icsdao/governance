# ICS Tool Access Policy

This document outlines how access to tools and platforms is managed at the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS).

## Purpose

Effective tool access management enables ICS to:
- Maintain appropriate security and privacy controls
- Ensure the right people have access to the tools they need
- Create clear accountability for tool usage
- Facilitate smooth onboarding and offboarding
- Track and manage tool-related expenses

## Core Tools and Platforms

ICS uses the following core tools and platforms:

### Governance and Documentation
- **GitHub**: Governance documentation repository
- **CharmVerse**: Operational documentation and collaboration
- **Discord**: Team communication and coordination

### Web3 Infrastructure
- **Multisig Wallet**: Treasury management (0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8)
- **Hats Protocol**: Role-based permissions (https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/100/119)
- **Snapshot**: Formal voting ([SNAPSHOT_SPACE])

### Program Tools
- **Thing Library Management System**: Inventory and lending management
- **Repair Caf√© Tracking System**: Event management and impact tracking
- **Website CMS**: Content management for communitysustainability.ca

## Role-Based Access

Access to tools is based on roles defined in the Hats Protocol:

### Core Team Members
- Have access to all operational tools
- Have view access to all documentation
- Have proposal and voting rights in governance tools

### Program Contributors
- Have access to tools specific to their program area
- Have view access to relevant documentation
- Have limited administrative access based on role

### General Contributors
- Have access to specific tools related to their contribution
- Have view access to public documentation
- May have limited administrative access for specific tasks

## Access Management

### Onboarding Process

When a new contributor joins:
1. The appropriate Hat is assigned based on their role
2. Tool access is automatically provisioned based on the Hat
3. The contributor receives an onboarding orientation to relevant tools
4. Initial credentials and access points are shared securely

### Permission Changes

When a contributor's role changes:
1. Their Hat assignment is updated
2. Tool access is automatically adjusted
3. The contributor is notified of access changes
4. Additional training is provided if needed

### Offboarding Process

When a contributor leaves:
1. Their Hat is revoked
2. Tool access is automatically removed
3. Shared credentials are rotated
4. Knowledge transfer is completed before departure

## Security Practices

### Credentials Management

- **Individual Accounts**: Where possible, contributors use individual accounts
- **Shared Credentials**: Managed through secure password management
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for critical systems
- **Regular Rotation**: Shared credentials are rotated quarterly

### Access Reviews

- **Quarterly Audit**: Regular review of all tool access
- **Documentation**: Access configurations are documented
- **Compliance**: Ensuring alignment with relevant regulations

## Special Access Types

### Administrative Access

- Limited to Core Team members
- Requires additional security measures
- Used only for specific administrative tasks
- Documented usage for accountability

### Financial Tools Access

- Limited to authorized treasury signers
- Requires multi-signature approval for transactions
- Subject to additional monitoring and verification
- Regular rotation of signers

## Technology Procurement

### New Tool Adoption

New tools are adopted through a process that includes:
1. Needs assessment and alignment with mission
2. Privacy and security evaluation
3. Integration with existing systems
4. Role-based access planning
5. Training and documentation

### Cost Management

- Tool costs are tracked and reviewed quarterly
- Opportunities for consolidation are regularly evaluated
- Open-source alternatives are preferred when appropriate
- Cost-sharing with partner organizations is explored

## Amendments

This tool access policy may be amended through the proposal process outlined in the [Proposal Process](../metagovernance/proposal_process.md) document.
