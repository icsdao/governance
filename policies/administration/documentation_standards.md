# ICS Documentation Standards

This document outlines standards and practices for creating, maintaining, and organizing documentation at the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS).

## Purpose

Effective documentation enables ICS to:
- Preserve institutional knowledge and memory
- Ensure transparency and accountability
- Enable smooth onboarding and knowledge transfer
- Support consistent operations
- Build trust with stakeholders

## Documentation Types

ICS maintains the following types of documentation:

### Governance Documentation

- **Location**: GitHub repository at `/Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/governance`
- **Purpose**: Establish the foundational agreements, policies, and procedures that guide the organization
- **Key Documents**: Cell State, agreements, policies, archives
- **Update Process**: Follows the process outlined in the [Governance](../../governance.md) document

### Operational Documentation

- **Location**: CharmVerse at https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-workspace-6136932233367063
- **Purpose**: Guide day-to-day operations and program implementation
- **Key Documents**: Meeting notes, task boards, project plans, templates
- **Update Process**: Maintained by relevant team members with regular reviews

### External Communication

- **Location**: Website at https://communitysustainability.ca/
- **Purpose**: Share information with the broader community and stakeholders
- **Key Documents**: Program descriptions, impact reports, announcements
- **Update Process**: Coordinated by the communications team

### Impact Documentation

- **Location**: Multiple (CharmVerse, website, on-chain)
- **Purpose**: Record and verify the impact of ICS programs and activities
- **Key Documents**: Impact reports, hypercerts, attestations
- **Update Process**: Regular updates following program activities and events

## Documentation Standards

### Formatting

All ICS documentation follows these formatting standards:

- **File Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `resource-allocation.md`)
- **Markdown**: Most documentation is written in Markdown for consistency and portability
- **Headers**: Use appropriate header levels (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for non-sequential items, numbered lists for sequences or steps
- **Links**: Use relative links within documentation repositories
- **Plain Language**: Write clearly and concisely, avoiding jargon when possible

### Content Structure

Documentation should include:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Purpose**: Brief explanation of why the document exists
- **Scope**: What the document covers and what it doesn't
- **Content**: Well-organized information with clear headings
- **Related Documents**: Links to related resources
- **Version Information**: Date of last update and change history for significant documents

### Permissions and Access

- **Public Information**: Governance documentation, program descriptions, impact reports
- **Internal Information**: Operational details, meeting notes, works in progress
- **Sensitive Information**: Personal data, financial details, authentication credentials

## Documentation Processes

### Creation

New documentation should:
- Follow established templates when available
- Be reviewed by at least one other team member
- Include metadata (date, author, purpose)
- Be stored in the appropriate repository

### Maintenance

Existing documentation should:
- Have a designated owner responsible for keeping it current
- Be reviewed at least annually
- Include version history for significant changes
- Remain accessible through consistent locations and naming

### Archiving

Outdated documentation should:
- Be clearly marked as archived
- Remain accessible for reference
- Include links to successor documents when applicable
- Preserve historical information of organizational value

## Tools and Technology

ICS uses the following tools for documentation:

- **GitHub**: For governance documentation and version control
- **CharmVerse**: For operational documentation and collaboration
- **Discord**: For communication and coordination
- **Google Workspace**: For collaborative drafting and spreadsheets

## On-Chain Documentation

Some ICS documentation has on-chain components:

- **Hypercerts**: On-chain attestations of impact
- **Snapshot**: Record of formal votes and decisions
- **Hats Protocol**: Role definitions and assignments

These on-chain elements should be linked from the relevant off-chain documentation for context and explanation.

## Amendments

This documentation standards policy may be amended through the proposal process outlined in the [Proposal Process](../metagovernance/proposal_process.md) document.
